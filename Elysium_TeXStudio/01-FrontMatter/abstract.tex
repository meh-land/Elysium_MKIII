\chapter*{Abstract}

According to studies released by the International Labour Organization (ILO), over 2.3 million people suffer work-related accidents. The proposed solution for this problem is using autonomous robot to limit said accidents.

The project is an autonomous robot capable of localizing itself accompanied with a GUI for task management and monitoring; with features ranging from challenging environment traversal, a solid mechanical and electrical infrastructure, to advanced algorithms in order to meet the required specifications. 

This documentation contains the thought process and implementation of this project, along with all the relevant theoretical background, and the final results. The project is fully open-source and available at our \href{https://github.com/orgs/meh-land/repositories}{\color{blue2}Github repository}.
